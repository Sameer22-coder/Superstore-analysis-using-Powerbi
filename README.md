# 🛒 Superstore Sales Dashboard | Power BI Project

This repository contains an interactive Power BI report analyzing **retail sales data** from a fictional Superstore. The dashboard provides key insights into **sales, profit, customer segments, shipping performance, and product-level trends**.

## 📌 Project Summary

The Superstore dataset simulates a retail business across various states in the U.S. Using this dataset, I created a clean and insightful dashboard to answer questions like:

- Which products and regions generate the most profit?
- What customer segments are most valuable?
- Which products or states are causing losses?
- How do sales vary across time and seasons?
- How does shipping mode impact delivery and profit?
